## **Instructions for Usage**

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - Create a repository named exactly like your **GitHub username** (e.g., if your username is `johnDoe`, the repository should be named `johnDoe`).
   
2. **Organize Your Assets**:  
   - Create a folder named `assets` in the root directory of your repository.  
   - Upload your **banner image**, **screenshots**, and **GIFs** to the `assets` folder.  
   - Reference the assets in the markdown using the relative path: `./assets/your-image.png`.

3. **Customize the Content**:  
   - Replace `[Your Name]`, `[Your Role/Title]`, and other placeholders with your actual information.  
   - Update the links to your live projects, GitHub repositories, and social profiles.

4. **Deploy on GitHub**:  
   - Push your changes to the main branch of the newly created repository.  
   - Your customized README will now display on your GitHub profile.

## **Add-On Tips**

- **Dark Mode Compatibility**: Test your design in both GitHub’s light and dark themes.
